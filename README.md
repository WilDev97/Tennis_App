## AI-Powered Tennis Coaching System

## Overview

AceApp leverages the capabilities of OpenAI and sophisticated data structures to offer personalized tennis coaching through an interactive application. The system analyses a player's performance, identifies areas of improvement, and recommends customized coaching advice.

## How It Works

The AI model is trained on a diverse dataset including player performance stats, their strength and weaknesses, playing styles, and professional coaching strategies. The application interacts with the user to gather information about their tennis performance and uses machine learning to offer actionable advice for improvement.
